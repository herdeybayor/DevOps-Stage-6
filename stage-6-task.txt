:rocket: DevOps Intern Stage 6 Task → Containerise, Deploy, Automate, and Secure a Microservices TODO Application
Hey Cool Keeds! :wave: :cycy-side-eye:
For this stage, you will work in ONE repository - Fork this repo. After forking, inside it, you will create an infra/ directory that contains:
Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
Ansible for server configuration and application deployment
CI/CD pipelines for infra and app changes
Drift detection + email notification logic
Part 1 — Application Containerisation
1. Repository Setup
Fork the original application repository
Clone your fork
Add an infra/ directory to this same repository
2. Application Components
You will containerise the following:
Frontend — Vue.js
Auth API — Go
Todos API — Node.js
Users API — Java Spring Boot
Log Processor — Python
Redis Queue
3. Containerisation Requirements
Create a Dockerfile for each service
Create a root-level docker-compose.yml that runs everything
The application must start with:
docker compose up -d
4. Domain & SSL with Traefik
You must configure:
Traefik reverse proxy
HTTPS certificates
Automatic HTTP → HTTPS redirection
Either subdomains or /api/* routing patterns
Expected example endpoints:
https://your-domain.com
https://your-domain.com/api/auth
https://your-domain.com/api/todos
https://your-domain.com/api/users
5. Expected Behaviour
Login page accessible at your domain
Login redirects to TODO dashboard
Direct API access:
Auth → “Not Found”
Todos → “Invalid Token”
Users → “Missing or invalid Authorisation header”
Part 2 — Infrastructure & Automation (Inside infra/)
Everything below must be placed under your infra/ directory.
A. Terraform (Idempotent Infrastructure + Drift-Safe)
Your Terraform code must:
Provision the cloud server
Configure security groups
Store state in a remote backend
Generate an Ansible inventory file dynamically
Call Ansible automatically after provisioning
Be fully idempotent:
Re-running terraform should do nothing unless changes exist
No recreation of resources unless drift occurs
Mandatory Feature: Drift Detection + Email Alert
Your CI/CD must:
Run terraform plan
Detect if drift exists (any planned change)
Always email the user when drift is detected
Pause and wait for manual approval before continuing
Only run terraform apply after approval
If no drift → proceed automatically.
This ensures safety, transparency, and full control.
B. Ansible (Server Setup + App Deployment)
Create two roles inside infra/ansible/roles/:
1. dependencies/
Installs:
Docker
Docker Compose
Git
Required packages for Traefik
2. deploy/
Handles:
Cloning your application repo
Pulling latest changes
Starting services with docker-compose
Setting up Traefik and SSL
Idempotent deployment (no restart unless files changed)
C. CI/CD Pipeline Automation
Your CI/CD must:
Trigger infrastructure workflow when:
Anything inside infra/terraform/** changes
Anything inside infra/ansible/** changes
Trigger app deployment when:
Any service folder changes
docker-compose.yml changes
Required Behaviours
Terraform plan → drift detection
Email user on drift
Pause for approval
Apply only after approval
If no drift → apply automatically
Ansible runs only if server exists
App deploy runs only if code changed
Part 3 — Single Command Deployment
Locally or via CI/CD, the entire setup must work with:
terraform apply -auto-approve
This should:
Provision infra
Generate inventory
Run Ansible
Deploy application
Configure Traefik + SSL
Skip unchanged resources (idempotent)
Submission Requirements
1. Repository Link;
Your single GitHub repository URL
2. Required Screenshots;
Login page on your domain
TODO dashboard
Successful Terraform apply
Terraform “No changes” output
Drift detection email alert
Ansible deployment output
3. URL;
Frontend (e.g your-domain.com)
4. Interview;
Create a clear presentation slide for your interview presentation where you will defend and explain your entire setup end-to-end
NOTE: This is an individual Task. You must pass the task to get promoted.
